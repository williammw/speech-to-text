## Text Similarity Analysis

We compared the similarity between two long and complex Chinese articles using three different methods: **Doc2Vec**, **TF-IDF**, and **Simple TF-IDF**. 

### Method 1: Doc2Vec

The first method used Doc2Vec model, which infers document vectors from the articles' tokens and computes their cosine similarity. The cosine similarity score between the two articles is **0.47109923**.

### Method 2: TF-IDF

The second method used the TF-IDF vectorizer to represent each article, which takes into account the importance of words in distinguishing between articles. The cosine similarity score between the two articles is **0.0007552870090634441**.

### Method 3: Simple TF-IDF

The third method used a simple TF-IDF vectorizer to represent each article as a bag-of-words model, and then computes the cosine similarity between the two articles based on the frequency of words they share. The cosine similarity score between the two articles is **0.1261650413399344**.

The three methods use different ways to compute similarity, which may lead to different results. In general, Method 1 (Doc2Vec) and Method 2 (TF-IDF) are more commonly used and considered more accurate for text similarity tasks. However, in this case, the cosine similarity score from Method 1 is much higher than the other two methods, which may suggest that the two articles have more similar context than the other two methods indicate.

Therefore, we recommend using multiple methods to compare the similarity between the two articles and carefully examining the results before drawing any conclusions.
